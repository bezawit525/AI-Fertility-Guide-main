## 📖 Module Documentation

### `app.py` — Main Application

The entry point of the application. Handles:

- **Page configuration** — Sets the page title, icon, layout, and meta info
- **Sidebar navigation** — Renders navigation buttons (Home, Profile, Personalized Advice, Help) and the API key input
- **Page routing** — Uses `st.session_state['current_page']` to route between `welcome`, `questions`, `chat`, and `clinics` views
- **Welcome page** — Displays a cover image and three informational cards (Mental Health Education, Shared Decision-Making, Personalized Recommendations)

### `assistant.py` — OpenAI Integration (`PetalAssitant` class)

Core AI functionality wrapper around the OpenAI API:

- **`create_openai_assistant_prompt(user_data)`** — Constructs a detailed prompt from the user's profile data (age, gender, health status, description)
- **`generate_response(user_data, api_key)`** — Sends the constructed prompt to GPT-4 Turbo and returns personalized mental health advice
- **`chat(messages)`** — Handles multi-turn conversation by passing the full message history to the model
- **`text_to_speech(text, voice)`** — Converts text to speech using OpenAI's TTS-1 model and saves to `audio.mp3`
- **`transcribe(audio_path)`** — Transcribes audio recordings to text using OpenAI Whisper

### `questions.py` — Questionnaire System

A multi-page questionnaire flow with progress tracking:

- **`collect_user_needs()`** — Audio recording for the user to describe their needs, with Whisper-based transcription
- **`collect_personal_info()`** — Collects age and gender identity
- **`collect_health_status()`** — Captures overall health rating and symptom descriptions
- **`collect_other_info()`** — Free-text input for lifestyle, mental health, and economic factors
- **`privacy_concent()`** — Collects explicit user consent before processing data
- **`compile_user_data()`** — Aggregates all session state data into a structured dictionary for AI processing
- **`navigate()`** — Handles page-to-page navigation with Back/Next buttons

### `response.py` — Personalized Advice & Chat

Manages the AI response display and interactive chat:

- **`display_response()`** — Generates personalized advice using the user's profile, plays it as audio, and initiates an ongoing chat session
- **`autoplay_audio(file_path)`** — Embeds and auto-plays the generated MP3 audio in the browser
- **`save_feedback(user_data, feedback)`** — Placeholder for persisting user feedback (extensible to database integration)

### `clinics.py` — Clinic Finder

Interactive map-based clinic locator:

- Displays nearby clinics on a **PyDeck** interactive map with labeled markers
- Shows clinic names, coordinates, and services offered via tooltips
- Currently uses sample clinic data (extensible to live API integration)

### `figma.py` — UI Prototype Components

Contains alternative UI layout prototypes:

- **`figma_welcome()`** — An alternate welcome page layout with a "MOJO Plan" theme
- **`figma_profile()`** — A stepped card-based profile builder UI with audio recording support
